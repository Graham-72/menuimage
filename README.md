#  Menu Image

When editing a menu link, this module provides a file field to
upload an image to associate with a menu item.

The fid of that file is stored as 'image' the link's options array,
which may be passed as a parameter to file_load to obtain its
public:// uri, to be used with either file_build_uri or image_style_url.

This is a port from the Drupal module menuimage, version 7.x-1.1
